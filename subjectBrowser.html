<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;LC Subject Browser [demo/prototype]</h1>


 
<p>Browse from one book to more books in the tree of Library of Congress Subjects. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span onclick="toggleExplanation()" class="explanation" id="explanlabel" style="text-decoration:underline;color:blue">More...</span></p> 
<div id="explans" style="display:none;"> 
	<p class="explanation">Begin by searching for books by keyword (a general purpose search, usually for some topic). Each book shows you its Library of Congress class name, along with that class' parents all the way back to the root. Click on a class name to see its children. Click on the icon that looks like leaves to retrieve all the books in HOLLIS directly in that class. (The number next to the leaves tells you how many books that is. Note that you will only retrieve items directly in that class, not items in subclasses.)
	<p class="explanation">(<span onclick="rollupdown('LCSH','SHOW')" style="text-decoration:underline;color:blue">Click</span> for a Teachable Moment about Library of Congress Subject Headings vs. Class Numbers.)</p>
	<div id="LCSH" style="display:none">
		<p class="explanation">Every book that comes to the Library of Congress is given at least one Subject Heading (LCSH), and almost always more than one. For example, Darwin's <em>Origin of Species</em> is sensibly classified under "Evolution," "Natural selection," and "Evolution (Biology)." That's very helpful, but it doesn't tell you precisely  which other volumes the book ought to be placed between on the shelf. The Library Congress does that by assigning it a <a href="http://www.loc.gov/aba/cataloging/classification/">Library of Congress Classification</a> (LCC) code, which looks like the sort of letter-and-number code you're familiar with from the spines of libraries books.</p> 
		<p class="explanation">To assign this class (LCC), typically a cataloguer will consider the complete set of subject headings (LCSH) assigned to the book,  will look at other books with overlapping sets of subject headings (LCSH), and will decide where it stands in the Library of Congress Classifications â€” another hierarchical system of topics, but this one designed specifically to enable the Library of Congress to figure out where to put books on shelves. These two classification systems &mdash; the Subject Headings and the Classifications &mdash; do not exactly coincide: you cannot with certainty figure out one from the other.</p>
		<p class="explanation"> LibraryCloud, from the Harvard Library Innovation Lab, has created a service that lets an application send it a Library of Congress Classification (LCC), and will return the other LCCs on the same branch, or its parents, or its children. The app you're using does is going to LibraryCloud for that information every time you click or search. <span onclick="rollupdown('LCSH','HIDE')" style="text-decoration:underline;color:blue">Close</span></p> 
		</div> 
	<p class="explanation">If "Use search term to filter subject search results" is checked, you'll only see books in that class that have that keyword, which may be none. If it is unchecked, you'll see all the books in that class within the Harvard Library collection</p>
	<p class="explanation">Choose a library from the pulldown menu to see only the items in that library's collection.</p>
	<p class="explanation">Works are ranked by StackScore, a rough measure of how often they have been used by the Harvard community.</p>
	<p class="explanation">This demo app was written by a non-developer in the <a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu">Harvard Library Innovation Lab</a>. It is not robust software. </p><p class="explanation"> The metadata is maintained by <a href="http://librarycloud.harvard.edu">LibraryCloud</a>.
