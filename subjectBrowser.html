<!-- Library of Congress Subject Browser
**   Uses the LibraryCloud API to browse items in the Harvard University Library
**      by Library of Congress Class names.
**   Written by a non-developer at the Harvard Library Innovation Lab,
**      so pardon the lack of skill, and don't blame the Lab for it.
**   This is presented as open source software.

<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;LC Subject Browser [demo/prototype]</h1>


 
<p>Browse from one book to more books in the tree of Library of Congress Subjects. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span onclick="toggleExplanation()" class="explanation" id="explanlabel" style="text-decoration:underline;color:blue">More...</span></p> 
<div id="explans" style="display:none;"> 
	<p class="explanation">Begin by searching for books by keyword (a general purpose search, usually for some topic). Each book shows you its Library of Congress class name, along with that class' parents all the way back to the root. Click on a class name to see its children. Click on the icon that looks like leaves to retrieve all the books in HOLLIS directly in that class. (The number next to the leaves tells you how many books that is. Note that you will only retrieve items directly in that class, not items in subclasses.)
	<p class="explanation">If the box next to the search box is clicked, you'll only see books in that class that have that keyword, which may be none.</p>
	<p class="explanation">The last item in a branch is grayed out because you're already seeing its children in the list below it.</p>
	<p class="explanation">Works are ranked by StackScore, a rough measure of how often they have been used by the Harvard community.</p>
	<p class="explanation">This demo app was written by a non-developer in the <a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu">Harvard Library Innovation Lab</a>.
